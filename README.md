## Installation üíª

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mohammad-Ali-Soomro/nasa-space-tracker.git
```

## Setup & API Key üîë

This project uses NASA's APIs which require an API key. To run the project:

1. Get a free API key from [NASA's API portal](https://api.nasa.gov/)
2. When you first open the application, you'll be prompted to enter your API key
3. The key will be stored locally in your browser and not shared

Alternatively, you can add your API key as a URL parameter when first loading the page:
```
https://your-github-pages-url.com/?api_key=YOUR_NASA_API_KEY
```

The key will be stored locally and removed from the URL immediately.

**Note:** If you don't provide an API key, the application will use NASA's DEMO_KEY which has strict rate limits.
